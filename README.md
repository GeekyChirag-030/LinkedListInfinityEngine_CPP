A fully-featured, menu-driven, CLI-based, object-oriented Linked List Engine built in C++.  
This is not just another linked list program — this is a **structure-level simulation framework** that lets you interactively build, manage, manipulate, and visualize how linked lists work under the hood with memory-safe pointer manipulation and operator overloading.

---

## Overview

This engine was engineered and structured to provide a **clear understanding of how Linked Lists behave** from insertion to deletion, with intuitive, keyboard-based controls, all running in the **command-line interface (CLI)** — efficient, powerful, and distraction-free.

>  Tailored for **DSA learners**, **competitive programmers**, ** Problem Solvers ** and those who want to **master pointers , DSA Linked List and OOP structure**.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

`LinkedListInfinityEngine_CPP` is a **Linked List toolkit simulator** built completely manually using pure `Node*` pointer logic.

Not just a DSA-project — it’s a **command-line engine** where users can take full control of:
- creation,
- deletion,
- insertion,
- reverse,
- search,
- and validation of linked list nodes.

Easy-to-understand printed interface + clean OOP-based structure makes it perfect for:
-  Learning  
-  Problem Solving  
-  Academic Demonstration  
-  Terminal Tooling

##  Features & Functionalities

| Category            | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Create List         | Create new linked list with user-defined size and data |
| Insert Node         | At head, tail, or any custom index |
| Delete Node         | From head, tail, or any index |
| Operator Overload   | `+`, `++`, `-`, `--`, `>>`, `<<` |
| Reverse Print       | Print the list in reverse using recursion |
| Search Node         | Find a node by data and return its 1-based index |
| Size Tracking       | Auto-tracks list size with every insert/delete |
| Head & Tail Access  | Print head and tail data directly |
| Clear List          | Completely deletes list and frees memory |
| Rules Interface     | Prints full rules and command menu anytime |
| Menu Driven System  | Interactive CLI experience with command prompts |

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Data Structure**: Singly Linked List
- **Environment**: Console / Terminal / CMD / PowerShell
- **Memory Management**: Manual (via `new` and `delete`)
- **Build Type**: CLI Executable or Source-based

##  Operator Overloading Reference

| Operator | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `>>`     | Input: Create linked list from scratch |
| `<<`     | Output: Print linked list from head to null |
| `+`      | Add node at a user-specified index |
| `-`      | Delete node from a specified index |
| `++`     | Append node to tail |
| `--`     | Delete node from tail |

## Object-Oriented Design
Concept	Applied
-  Encapsulation	✅ All data members are private
-  Public API Access	✅ Interactions happen only through public member methods
-  Operator Overloading	✅ +, -, ++, --, <<, >> for intuitive usage
-  Class - solLList	✅ Manages full linked list lifecycle: creation to flushing
-  Recursion	✅ Used in reverse printing logic

---

## Internal Architecture

| Component       | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `headNode`      | Points to first node |
| `tailNode`      | Points to last node |
| `linkedList`    | Main list pointer, used for traversals |
| `nNodesSize`    | Auto-updated list size |
| `Node struct`   | Contains `int Data` and `Node* next` |
| `class solLList`| Fully encapsulates all list logic |

---

## Object-Oriented Blueprint

This project obeys OOP principles strictly:

- **Encapsulation** ✅  
- **Data Hiding** ✅ (`private` members only accessible via public helpers)  
- **Operator Overloading** ✅ (C++ power in action)  
- **Modular Design** ✅ (core logic separated cleanly)  


---

## Sample Outputs
```txt
Enter the Size of Linked List: 3
Input Node 1: 10
Input Node 2: 20
Input Node 3: 30

Linked List:
10 --> 20 --> 30 --> NULL

Adding Node at Index 2:
Updated List:
10 --> NEW --> 20 --> 30 --> NULL

Deleting Node at Index 3:
Updated List:
10 --> NEW --> 30 --> NULL

Recursive Reverse:
NULL <-- 30 <-- NEW <-- 10
```

## To Compile Manually

```bash
g++ useLList.cpp -o LList.exe
./LList.exe
```

| ✅ Edge Case | Handled? |
|-------------|----------|
| Insertion at invalid index | ✅ |
| Deletion from invalid index | ✅ |
| Operations on empty list | ✅ |
| Deleting last remaining node | ✅ |
| Adding to empty list | ✅ |
| List size = 0 update | ✅ |
